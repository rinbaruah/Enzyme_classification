The Enzyme Commission (EC) system is a widely accepted classification system used to categorize enzymes based on their catalytic activities. Enzymes play crucial roles in biological processes by accelerating chemical reactions and facilitating various metabolic pathways within living organisms. The EC system assigns a unique EC number to each enzyme, which provides valuable information about its function and specificity.

EC1 represents the class of enzymes known as oxidoreductases. These enzymes catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, which involve the transfer of electrons between molecules. Oxidoreductases are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including energy production, biosynthesis, and detoxification. Examples of oxidoreductases include dehydrogenases, oxidases, reductases, and peroxidases.<br> </br>
    The <b> Enzyme Commission (EC) </b> system provides a systematic and standardized approach for classifying enzymes based on their catalytic activities. EC1 represents the class of oxidoreductases, which participate in oxidation-reduction reactions, while the second digit in the EC number provides more specific information about the enzyme's function. This classification system facilitates the study of enzymes and helps researchers gain insights into their structure, function, and potential applications in various fields, including medicine, biotechnology, and industrial processes.

```


Great ! We have all the libraries loaded. Next, we are gonna load the required dataset for conducting the enzyme classification analysis. 

We will use one dataset for the purpose of exploratory data analysis and training the classification model while the test dataset for testing the classification model on a completely new dataset.


After reading the data, let us see how the train dataset looks like.

```{r read-data}

df_train <- read_csv("data/train.csv")
df_test <-  read_csv("data/test.csv")
head(df_train)
```

We can observe that there are multiple process parameters present in the dataset which can help us analyse and predict the values of __EC1 and EC2__. But what do all these variables tell us ? Based on the information from [Panmie's Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tumpanjawat/s3e18-eda-cluster-ensemble-ada-cat-gb/notebook), following are the explanations of each of these variables.

1. __Id__: This feature represents the identifier or unique identification number of a molecule. It serves as a reference but doesn't directly contribute to the predictive model.

2. __BertzCT__: This feature corresponds to the Bertz complexity index, which measures the structural complexity of a molecule. It can provide insights into the intricacy of molecular structures.

# Data cleaning

## Removal of unnecessary variables

In the first section, we will try to remove all the variables that will not be required for our analysis.

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_train <- df_train %>% select(-c("id","EC3","EC4","EC5","EC6"))
```

## Check for null values

In this step, we will try to check for the presence of null values in the dataset.


```{r missvis,fig.cap="Missingness in the dataset",fig.align='center'}
gg_miss_var(df_train)
```

Based on the figure \@ref(fig:missvis), we can observe that

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
‚úÖ  The dataset does not contain any missing values. This indicates that we have a clean dataset which is ready for EDA and further analysis.
</div>



# Exploratory Data Analysis

We can observe that there are a total of __32 variables__ in the current dataset !!! <code style="background:yellow;color:red">These are a lot more than what we would ideally like to analyse.</code> Such types of datasets require a special kind of analysis called as __High Dimensional Data Analysis__ which concentrate majorly on techniques such as clustering and pricipal component analysis to reduce the number of variables without completely losing data. While this is the right way to go about it, this notebook will however study the correlation of each variable and try to reduce the number of variables which are observed to show high multi-collinearity.


## Correlation plot


Let us understand how each of these variables correlate.

```{r corrplot, fig.cap="Correlation plot",fig.align='center'}
corrplot(cor(df_train),        # Correlation matrix
         method = "number", # Correlation plot method
         type = "full",    # Correlation plot style (also "upper" and "lower")
         diag = TRUE,      # If TRUE (default), adds the diagonal
         tl.col = "black", # Labels color
         bg = "white",     # Background color
         title = "Correlation plot",       # Main title
         col = NULL,
         number.cex = 0.4,
         tl.cex = .5)

```

As we can observe from figure \@ref(fig:corrplot),

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
None of the variables have an <strong> unusually high correlation with EC1 or EC2 </strong>. However, we do observe multiple variables which have high correlation to each other. This pheonmenon is called <strong> multi-collinearity </strong>. Let us set a correlation threshold of 75%. Any variables with correlation values higher than this will be dropped from the dataset.
</div>

```{r corrdrop,echo=TRUE}
df_corr = cor(df_train)
hc = findCorrelation(df_corr, cutoff=0.75) # Removing variables with greater than 75% correlation
hc = sort(hc)
df_train_new = df_train[,-c(hc)]
```

Now that we have removed the variables that observed to show multi-collinearity, let us now see how the revised dataset looks like.

```{r}
head(df_train_new) %>%
DT::datatable(width = 500, height = 500, options = list(pageLength = 6))
```

Let us now create the correlation plot of the revised dataset.

```{r corrplotnew, fig.cap="Correlation plot of revised dataset",fig.align='center'}
corrplot(cor(df_train_new),        # Correlation matrix
         method = "number", # Correlation plot method
         type = "full",    # Correlation plot style (also "upper" and "lower")
         diag = TRUE,      # If TRUE (default), adds the diagonal
         tl.col = "black", # Labels color
         bg = "white",     # Background color
         title = " ",       # Main title
         col = NULL,
         number.cex = 0.6,
         tl.cex = .5)

```
Figure \@ref(fig:corrplotnew) depicts the correlation values of all the variables which do not observe to demonstrate multi-collinearity.

## Univariate analysis

Now that we have figured out the variables of interest, we will perform a univariate analysis of the revised dataset. One of the best ways to study the overall distribution of the variables is through a faceted histogram. Let us dive deeper.

```{r facethist,fig.cap="Univariate analysis of variables",fig.align='center'}


pl1 <- ggplot(data = gather(df_train_new), aes(x = value,fill = factor(key))) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~key,scales ="free_x") + theme_classic() + ggtitle("Univariate analysis of variables") + theme(legend.position = "none",plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + labs(y="Number of instances",x = "Value of variable")
pl1

```

Based on our analysis of figure \@ref(fig:facethist), we can observe that 

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
while most variables range over a large scale in the X-axis, certain variables, namely <b> FpDensityMorgan1 </b> and <b> Kappa3 </b> range over a very small scale on the X-axis. This indicates that there is a large scale difference among the various variables. Hence, the dataset could benefit from standardisation technique at a later point of the analysis.
</div>

## Multi-variate analysis

Now that we have performed a univariate analysis, it is now time to perform a multi-variate analysis to understand our variables better.

## FpDensityMorgan1 and Kappa3

Let us observe how do these variables differ for each values of EC.

```{r KappVMorgEC1,fig.cap="Kappa3 Vs FpDensityMorgan1 for EC1",fig.align='center'}
pl2 <- ggplot(data = df_train_new %>% filter(FpDensityMorgan1 > -5), aes(x =FpDensityMorgan1, y=Kappa3)) + geom_point(aes(color = factor(EC1))) + theme_classic() + labs(color = "EC1 indicator")
pl2

```


```{r KappVMorgEC2,fig.cap="Kappa3 Vs FpDensityMorgan1 for EC1",fig.align='center'}
pl2 <- ggplot(data = df_train_new %>% filter(FpDensityMorgan1 > -5), aes(x =FpDensityMorgan1, y=Kappa3)) + geom_point(aes(color = factor(EC2))) + theme_classic() + labs(color = "EC2 indicator")
pl2

```

Based on the analysis from figures \@ref(fig:KappVMorgEC1) and \@ref(fig:KappVMorgEC2), we can observe that 

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
Most values of Kappa3 lie around 0 for both EC1 and EC2. There are very datapoints which are higher than 0. Hence, majority of the datapoints can be clustered into one group.
</div>
